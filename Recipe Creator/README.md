# Automatic Recipe Creator

---

## Overview

The **Automatic Recipe Creator** is a smart tool that generates recipe ideas based on the food ingredients provided by the user. The system not only provides recipes but also uses DALL·E to generate visual representations of the dishes, making cooking more interactive and visually appealing.

---

## Why Create This?

The main motivation behind creating this tool is to help users make informed decisions about what they can cook with the ingredients they already have. Often, people struggle with meal ideas, and this system bridges that gap by suggesting recipes tailored to the user's available ingredients, accompanied by images that bring the recipe to life. 

---

## Key Features:

1. **Ingredient-based Recipe Suggestions**: The user inputs a list of ingredients, and the system generates possible recipes.
2. **DALL·E Image Generation**: Each recipe is presented with an AI-generated image, offering users a visual reference of what the final dish looks like.
3. **NLP-driven Querying**: The system understands user input via natural language processing and converts it into structured data to fetch the relevant recipes.
4. **Fast Recipe Retrieval**: SQL queries are used to efficiently search for and retrieve recipes from a database based on the user's ingredients.

---

## Advantages of Using This Tool:

- **Personalized Experience**: Users receive tailored recipes based on what they already have at home.
- **Engaging Visuals**: Images generated by DALL·E offer a preview of the final dish, which makes the cooking experience more enjoyable.
- **Efficient**: The tool saves time by providing immediate recipe suggestions and visuals without the need to search manually.

## Key Code Explanations:

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for User Inputs:

One of the most critical aspects of this project is how the system interprets the user's ingredient list. I used GPT-3.5-turbo to process the input and convert it into an SQL query. This step allows the tool to automatically generate relevant queries based on natural language inputs.

```python
def generate_sql_query(ingredients):
    prompt = f"Generate an SQL query to find recipes using {', '.join(ingredients)}."
    sql_query = gpt_model.generate(prompt)
    return sql_query
```
### Why is it Important?

This code is essential because it serves as the core logic of the system. It takes the natural language ingredient list provided by the user and translates it into structured data, such as SQL queries, which are then used to retrieve relevant recipes from the database. This step allows the tool to understand the user’s input and provide accurate suggestions.

---

### 2. SQL Query for Recipe Retrieval:

After the NLP interprets the ingredients, the system generates SQL queries to search the recipe database. These queries efficiently locate recipes that match the ingredients provided by the user.

**Explanation:**  
The SQL query is designed to extract recipes from the database based on the user’s input. Although the details of database connections and query execution are handled in the background, this code ensures that recipes are retrieved accurately and quickly.

---

### 3. DALL·E for Image Generation:

For each suggested recipe, an image is generated using DALL·E. This enhances the overall user experience by providing a visual representation of what the final dish will look like.

**Explanation:**  
By integrating DALL·E, the system becomes more interactive and visually appealing. The tool uses the recipe’s name to create an image, offering users a clear idea of the dish, which motivates them to try cooking it.

---

### 4. System Workflow:

The overall flow of the system begins with processing user inputs, then generating SQL queries to retrieve matching recipes, and finally generating images using DALL·E. Each step is designed to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Results and Benefits:

- The user provides a list of ingredients.
- The system suggests recipes based on those ingredients.
- Each recipe is presented with a DALL·E-generated image, making the process more engaging and easy to follow.
- The user saves time and gains inspiration to cook with what they have on hand.
