# Project Proposal: Natural Language to SQL Query Conversion using OpenAI API

## Overview
This project aims to streamline data retrieval from an SQL database by converting natural language commands into SQL queries using OpenAI’s API. This approach enables non-technical users to interact with databases without needing SQL knowledge, providing an intuitive interface through natural language processing (NLP).

## Key Objectives
- **Enable seamless data interaction** using natural language commands.
- **Reduce the need for SQL expertise** when querying databases.
- **Automate the transformation** of natural language into SQL queries, enhancing user productivity.

## Project Workflow

1. **Convert Tabular Data to SQL Database**
   - Use `pandas` to load and manipulate tabular data.
   - Transform this data into an SQL database structure, enabling queries on the dataset. This ensures the data is ready for SQL-based interactions.
   - Sample code for setting up the database:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine

     # Load the tabular data (e.g., from an Excel file)
     df = pd.read_excel('path_to_file.xlsx')
     
     # Create an in-memory SQL database
     engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
     df.to_sql('table_name', con=engine)
     ```

2. **Generate Natural Language Command (NLP Request)**
   - Users will input commands such as "Show all sales from last month." These requests will describe the data users want to retrieve, acting as the input for the OpenAI API.

3. **Convert NLP to SQL Query Using OpenAI API**
   - Use OpenAI’s API to process the natural language command and convert it into a valid SQL query.
   - Initial setup code:
     ```python
     import openai

     # Make sure to install the OpenAI package if not installed
     !pip install openai

     # Define the function to convert natural language to SQL query
     def natural_language_to_sql(natural_language_command):
         response = openai.Completion.create(
             engine="text-davinci-003",
             prompt=f"Convert this natural language command to an SQL query: {natural_language_command}",
             max_tokens=100
         )
         return response.choices[0].text.strip()
     ```

4. **Execute SQL Query on Database**
   - The SQL query generated by OpenAI is then executed on the SQL database to retrieve the required data.
   - Example execution code:
     ```python
     query = natural_language_to_sql("Show all sales from last month")
     result = pd.read_sql_query(query, con=engine)
     ```

5. **Verify and Display Results**
   - The results of the SQL query are returned and displayed to the user.

## Benefits to the Company
- **Improved Accessibility**: This system allows employees with little to no SQL knowledge to interact with the database.
- **Increased Efficiency**: By automating the conversion of natural language to SQL queries, users can retrieve data faster.
- **Scalability**: This approach can be adapted to various datasets and use cases across the company.

## Conclusion
This project will allow the company to leverage AI-powered NLP tools for efficient data querying, bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex databases.
